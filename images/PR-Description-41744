**Problem Summary:**
Configuring CUSTOM MAC on L3 Interface with 10G Breakout Port, L3 Traffic is blackholed

**Root Cause Analysis:**

1.     Packet is getting dropped because of the VSI Derivation is going wrong .
2.     VSI value is determined based on VLAN_DOMAIN, VLAN_ID. When the Custom MAC is configured, we will 
         update the VSI table and the Index for the  VSI  TABLE  is based on the Interface LIF.
3.      Here the MAC Address update is correctly happening in the VSI table but VLAN_DOMAIN is going wrong 
         due to which PACKET is Picking the wrong VSI

Why VLAN Domain is Not Programmed Correctly ?
ETHPM sends below three requests in the reload case.
 
a. Interface_PRE_CFG:  (ETHPM to ELTM)
In the Interface bring up, we set correct vlan_domain for the Rx Port
 
b. PORT_SPEED: (ETHPM to JER-USD)
JERUSD triggers breakout port init based on the type of transceiver we have in the Port. If we have 10G,it does a breakout internally.
In this INIT, it also resets the vlan_domain for the interface through jer_usd_tlv_jer_iftmc_tpid_init . This will reset the value we programmed in the previous step(a)
 
c. DOT1Q_ETHERTYPE : (ETHPM to JER_USD)
It will set vlan_domain which we reset in previous step (b)
 
This is how vlan_domain will be ZERO after Reload Module

**Summary of Code Fix:**
In the Step (b) we read the vlan_domain value from bcm_port_class_get and program the same sothat we avoid restting the vlan_domain  for the port.
